Speedup

For my speedup, I used the following case:

N = 6
T = [[1,2,3,4,5,6],[2,3,4,5,6,1],[3,4,5,6,1,2],[5,6,1,2,4,3],[4,1,6,3,2,5],[6,5,2,1,3,4]]
C = counts([5,4,4,3,2,1],[1,2,2,3,3,3],[6,5,4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,3,2,3]))

The speedup that I achieved was of a factor 12811.11. That is, tower was 12811.11 times as fast as plain_tower.



Ambiguous Puzzle

C = counts([4,3,3,2,1],[1,2,2,4,3],[5,4,2,2,1],[1,2,3,2,3])
T1 = [[1,2,3,4,5],[2,3,4,5,1],[4,5,1,3,2],[3,1,5,2,4],[5,4,2,1,3]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4,5],[2,3,4,5,1],[4,1,5,3,2],[3,5,1,2,4],[5,4,2,1,3]]
